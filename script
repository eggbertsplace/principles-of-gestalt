PRINCIPLES OF GESTALT

SLIDE 1 PRINCIPLES OF GESTALT
  - Max Wertheimer, Psychologist
  - observed a series of lights flashing on and off at a railroad crossing
  - similar to a movie theater marquee

  - to the observer, it appears as if a simple light moves around the marquee, from bulb to bulb, when in
    realtity it's a series of bulbs turning on and off without a light moving at all

  - this observation led to a set of descriptive principles about how we visually perceive objects.

SLIDE 2 PRINCIPLES OF GESTALT
  - loosly translated as "shape" or "form"
  - refers to how visual input is perceived by human brains
  - many of the design principles we follow arise out of gestalt theory

SLIDE 3 KEY IDEAS BEHIND GESTALT THEORY
  - EMERGENCE - "The whole is other than the sum of the parts" - Kurt Koffka
  - In chaos theory, emergence is the spontaneous appearance of order out of an apparently random background.

  Keep in Mind:
  - People will identify elements first by their general form.
  - Simple well defined object will communicate more quickly than a detailed object.

SLIDE 4 KEY IDEAS BEHIND GESTALT THEORY
  - REIFICATION (OUR MIND FILLS IN THE GAPS)

SLIDE 5 KEY IDEAS BEHIND GESTALT THEORY
  - REIFICATION (OUR MIND FILLS IN THE GAPS)

  - mental process involved in the 'bringing into being' of something.
  - In Gestalt this includes the addition of things which are not in the original image.

SLIDE 6 KEY IDEAS BEHIND GESTALT THEORY
  - MULTI-STABILITY (THE MIND SEEKS TO AVOID UNCERTAINTY)

  - Some objects can be perceived in more than one way
  - You can’t see both at once
  - Instead you bounce back and forth quickly between the two stable alternatives.
  - One will tend to be your dominant perception
  - the longer you go without begin able to see the other,
    the harder it will be to see that other perception.

SLIDE 7 KEY IDEAS BEHIND GESTALT THEORY
  - INVARIANCE (WE’RE GOOD AT RECOGNIZING SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES)

  - Things can be rotated, stretched, squeezed or otherwise distorted and yet they are still recognized.
  - We are particularly good at recognizing people.

SLIDE 8 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - LAW OF PRÄGNANZ (GOOD FIGURE, LAW OF SIMPLICITY)

    - We prefer things that are simple, clear and ordered.
    - Instinctually these things are safer.
    - They take less time for us to process and present less dangerous surprises.
    - Simple and familiar shapes will be seen first.
    - Primary shapes such as triangles, circles, squares will stand out, even if they overlap.

    - 'Prägnanz' is the German word for 'pithiness', which means 'concise and meaningful'

SLIDE 9 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - CLOSURE

    - As with Prägnanz, closure seeks simplicity
    - With closure we combine parts to form a simpler whole
    - Closure can be thought of as the glue holding elements together
    - It’s about the human tendency to seek and find patterns.

    Keep in mind:
    - If too much is missing, the elements will be seen as separate parts instead of a whole.


SLIDE 10 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - SYMMETRY AND ORDER

    - Symmetry gives us a feeling of solidity and order, which we tend to seek.
    - It’s our nature to impose order on chaos.
    - In the image above, you should see three pairs of opening and closing brackets.
    - The principle of proximity, which we’ll get to later in this post, might suggest
      we should see something else. That suggests symmetry takes precedence over proximity.

SLIDE 11 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - FIGURE AND GROUND
    - "Figure/ground refers to the relationship between positive elements and negative space."

    - When we look at something we separate out a foreground, or figure, and a background, or ground.
    - The foreground is usually the main subject on which we will subsequently focus, whilst the background is generally ignored.
    - It’s one of the first things people will do when looking at any composition.

SLIDE 12 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - UNIFORM CONNECTEDNESS
    - “Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.”

    - Of all the principles suggesting objects are related, uniform connectedness is the strongest.
    - Notice that the lines don’t need to touch the elements for the connection to be perceived.

SLIDE 13 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - COMMON REGIONS
    - “Elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region.”

    - Another way to show a connection between elements is to enclose them in some way.
    - Everything inside the enclosure is seen as related.
    - Everything outside the encloser is seen as separate.

SLIDE 14 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - PROXIMITY
    - “Objects that are closer together are perceived as more related than objects that are further apart.”

    - Proximity is similar to common regions but uses space as the enclosure.
    - The objects don’t need to be similar in any other way beyond being grouped near each other in space in order to be seen as having a proximity relationship.

SLIDE 15 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - CONTINUATION
    - “Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve.”

    - It’s instinct to follow a river, a path or a fence line.

SLIDE 16 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - COMMON FATE
    - “Elements that move in the same direction are perceived as more related than elements that are stationary or that move in different directions.”

    - Regardless of how far apart the elements are placed or how dissimilar they appear, if they are seen as moving or changing together, they’ll be perceived as being related.
    - The elements don’t need to be moving for the principle of common fate to be present. It’s more that they are seen as having a common destination.
    - For example, if four people are clustered together, but two are observed heading toward the right, they will be seen as having a common fate. Even if two are only looking in the same direction, they’ll be perceived as having a common fate.

SLIDE 17 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - PARALLELISM
    - “Elements that are parallel to each other are seen as more related than elements not parallel to each other.”

SLIDE 18 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - SIMILARITY
    - “Elements that share similar characteristics are perceived as more related than elements that don't share those characteristics.”

    - Any number of characteristics can be similar: color, shape, size, texture, etc.
    - When a viewer sees these similar characteristics, they perceive the elements as being related due to the shared characteristics.

    Example:
    An obvious place to find similarity online is in the color of links.
    Typically, links within content will be styled the same way, often blue and underlined.
    This lets the viewer know that the different pieces of text are related.
    Once one is discovered to be a link, it communicates the others are also links.

SLIDE 18 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - FOCAL POINTS
    - “Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer’s attention.”

    - This principle suggests that our attention will be drawn toward contrast,
      toward the element that is unlike the others in some way.
    - The principle of focal points likely arises out of our need to quickly identify the unknown to alert us to potential danger.
    - The principles of similarity and focal points are connected, and focal points can’t be seen without the presence of similarity among other elements.

SLIDE 18 GESTALT PRINCIPLES
    - PAST EXPERIENCES
    - “Elements tend to be perceived according to an observer's past experience.”

    - weakest gestalt principle
    - Past experience is unique to the individual, so it’s difficult to make assumptions about how it will be perceived.
    - However, there are common experiences we all share. For example, a lot of color meaning arises out of past experience.

SLIDE 19 SUMMARY OF GESTALT
    - Gestalt principles are important to understand.
    - They describe how (nearly) everyone visually perceives objects.
